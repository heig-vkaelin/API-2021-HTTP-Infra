## Step 2: Dynamic HTTP server with express.js

### Webcasts

* [Labo HTTP (2a): Application node "dockerisée"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSIrZ0Mmpis)
* [Labo HTTP (2b): Application express "dockerisée"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4qHbf_vMu0)

### Acceptance criteria

* You have a GitHub repo with everything needed to build the Docker image.
* You can do a demo, where you build the image, run a container and access content from a browser.
* You generate dynamic, random content and return a JSON payload to the client.
* You cannot return the same content as the webcast (you cannot return a list of people).
* You don't have to use express.js; if you want, you can use another JavaScript web framework or event another language.
* You have **documented** your configuration in your report.
